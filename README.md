# SkyForest
Physical Computing Final by Eli Zhang, Maria Fang and Tommy Payne. 


This project features a playful interaction between users and the artificial cloud. 
It tries to bring in to our everyday life a piece of nature and give people a fun, 
soothing and somewhat therapeutic experience though touch and sound. 


It was fabricated with three large pieces of wire mesh with polyester hot glued on top. 
The sensors were connected to the Arduino which, together with the speakers, was hidden on the ceiling.
